## Course Description

This course is aimed at biologists who wish to learn how to use R for data analysis. Participants are expected to have little to no experience using R, but are familiar with different types of biological data and basic statistics. This course will introduce participants to the R programming language provide a crash-course on how to use this tool for data wrangling, visualization and basic statistical testing. Participants who have specific interests/needs (such as those working with phylogenetic, GIS, sound recordings or other types of biological data) are encouraged to bring datasets with them.

The practical sessions of this course will heavily rely on the `tidyverse` in R. This is a great tool for manipulating and visualizing data. We will touch on some of the elements here, but for a much more in detail tutorial, I suggest [this R book](https://bookdown.org/ansellbr/WEHI_tidyR_course_book/) by Brendan Ansell.
