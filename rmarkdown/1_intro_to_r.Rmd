# What is R and why learn it?

R is programming language geared towards (but not exclusively for) statistics. However, it has evolved to be much more and as Biologists, there are many reasons to learn it:

* It is open source (and free!)
* There is an expansive community and lots of help!
* It is cross-platform (windows, linux, mac)
* It is object-oriented and intuitive
* It is always evolving
* It is a one-stop-shop: libraries for many different types of analyses
* It is widely used, even outside academia and one of the most popular languages for data science

# What can I expect from this course?

Learning any language does not happen over night and there is generally a steep learning curve. The same is true for R. Moreover, practice makes perfect. The idea of this course is to introduce you to the basic workings of R, with a biologist's interests in mind. Specifically, we will cover some basic statics and data visualization. Some parts may feel overwhelming, but hopefully, you will see the power of R.
